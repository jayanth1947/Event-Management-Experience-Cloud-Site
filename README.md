# Event Management System Experience Cloud Site

- We are developing an Event Management System clone that will allow attendees to view their upcoming events.

- New users who have not registered on the site will need to sign up before they can access it. Once registered, they can log in to the system.

- Existing users of the system will not need to register again and can simply log in to view their events.

- Project Documentation is attached below
