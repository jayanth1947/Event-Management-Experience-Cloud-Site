# Event Management System Experience Cloud Site

-This project is the development of an Event Management System Experience Cloud Site. Our goal is to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for managing events. The system will allow attendees to view their upcoming events, and new users will need to register on the site before they can access it. Existing users can simply log in to view their events.

## Getting Started
- To use our Event Management System, you will need to sign up and create an account. Once you have registered, you can log in and view your upcoming events.

## Prerequisites
- To use our system, you will need an internet connection and a web browser. We recommend using the latest version of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari.

## Installing
- There is no need to install anything to use our system. Simply navigate to our website and sign up to get started.

## Contributing
- We welcome contributions from the community. If you are interested in contributing, please fork our repository and submit a pull request. We will review your code and merge it if it meets our standards.
